## Coding Standards

### TypeScript/React

// Use functional components with TypeScript
const PatientDashboard: React.FC = () => {
// Use descriptive variable names
const [patientRecords, setPatientRecords] = useState<HealthRecord[]>([]);

// Comment complex logic
useEffect(() => {
// Fetch and decrypt patient records on mount
fetchPatientRecords();
}, []);

return (
<div className="dashboard-container">
{/* Component JSX */}
</div>
);
};


**Style Guidelines:**
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow Airbnb React/TypeScript style guide
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `const` over `let`
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Keep functions small and focused
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks

### Solidity

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.24;

/// @title Health Record Management
/// @notice Manages encrypted health records using FHE
/// @dev Uses Zama's fhEVM for encryption
contract CerebrumFHEVM {
/// @notice Adds a new health record for the patient
/// @param encryptedBloodSugar Encrypted blood sugar value
/// @dev Only callable by registered patients
function addHealthRecord(
einput encryptedBloodSugar,
einput encryptedCholesterol,
einput encryptedBMI,
bytes calldata inputProof
) external onlyPatient {
// Implementation
}
}


**Solidity Standards:**
- Follow Solidity 0.8.24 best practices
- Use NatSpec comments for all public functions
- Implement proper access control
- Include input validation
- Emit events for state changes
- Write comprehensive tests
- Gas optimization where possible

### File Naming

- React components: `PascalCase.tsx`
- Utilities: `camelCase.ts`
- Smart contracts: `PascalCase.sol`
- Tests: `ComponentName.test.tsx` or `ContractName.test.ts`

identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming,
diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

* **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
* **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
* **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
* **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community

* Pattern of inappropriate social contact

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of
acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in
response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive,
or harmful.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject
comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are
not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation
decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when
an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces.
Examples of representing our community include:

* Using an official project email address
* Posting via an official social media account
* Acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event
* Participating in project-related forums and chat rooms

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
reported to the project team responsible for enforcement at:

**conduct@cerebrum.health**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the
reporter of any incident.

### What to Include in a Report

* **Contact information** (if you wish to be contacted)
* **Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms)** of any individuals involved
* **Description of the incident**, including any available documentation
* **Where and when the incident occurred**
* **Whether the incident is ongoing**
* **Any other information** you believe we should have

### Confidentiality

All reports will be handled with discretion. We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Project maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining
the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed
unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from project maintainers, providing
clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the
behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No
interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with
those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This
includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels
like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including
sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public
communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or
private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction
with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period.
Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community
standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an
individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the
project community.
